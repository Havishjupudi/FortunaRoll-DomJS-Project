## Game Instructions

### Objective

Be the first player to reach 100 points!

### Game Setup

- The game is played by two players.
- Each player starts with a score of 0.
- Player 1 begins the game.

### How to Play

1. **Roll the Dice**: On your turn, click the **Roll Dice** button to roll a dice.
   - If you roll a number between 2 and 6, that number is added to your current score.
   - If you roll a 1, your turn ends, and your current score resets to 0. The other player then takes their turn.

2. **Hold**: At any time during your turn, you can choose to "Hold".
   - This adds your current score to your total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.
   - If your total score reaches or exceeds 100, you win the game!

### Additional Rules

- Players take turns to roll the dice and accumulate points.
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in their current score for that turn, and their turn ends.
- The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more points wins the game.
- Click the **New Game** button to reset the game and start over.

### Winning the Game

- The game ends immediately when a playerâ€™s total score reaches or exceeds 100.
- The winning player is declared, and the game resets for a new round.

### Good luck and have fun!
